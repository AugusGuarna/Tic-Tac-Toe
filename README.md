# My lil Tic-Tac-Toe
Basically, this is a project I started to think while I was trying to fall asleep. I know a lot of things are super basic or 0 optimum but since I kinda vomit the whole code I'm not feeling to think them again. If you want to optimize it or you want to make any change, just feel free. I'll also add an instruction manual on how I came to the solution.
